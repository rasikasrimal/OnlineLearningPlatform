# Online Learning Platform

## Description
Develop an online learning platform where users can enroll in courses, track their progress, and interact with instructors. The platform will feature user management, course management, enrollment, progress tracking, and communication between students and instructors.<br>
[Database Schema](https://github.com/rasikasrimal/OnlineLearningPlatform/blob/rasika/DB-Schema/readme.md#online-learning-platform-database-schema)

## Key Features
1. **User Management**: Register, login, profile management, and role-based access control (students, instructors, admins).
2. **Course Management**: Create, update, delete, and view courses, each with multiple modules and lessons.
3. **Enrollment**: Students can enroll in courses, view enrolled courses, and track their progress.
4. **Progress Tracking**: Track completion of lessons and modules.
5. **Communication**: Messaging system for students and instructors.
6. **Assessment**: Quizzes and assignments with automatic grading.

## Technologies
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA
- **Frontend**: Angular or React
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL
- **API Documentation**: Swagger
- **Build Tool**: Maven or Gradle
- **Testing**: JUnit, Mockito, Selenium
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines

## Skills Covered
1. **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer
2. **OOP Concepts**: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction
3. **Architectures**: MVC, Layered Architecture
4. **Diagrams**: Activity Diagrams, Class Diagrams, Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
5. **Database Design**: Entity-Relationship Diagrams (EER)
6. **Best Practices**: Code reviews, documentation, testing, CI/CD

## Project Plan

### 1. Project Setup
- Initialize Git repository
- Setup Spring Boot project with necessary dependencies
- Setup front-end project (Angular/React)
- Setup database

### 2. Requirement Analysis
- Gather and document requirements
- Create use case diagrams

### 3. System Design
- Create high-level architecture diagram
- Design database schema (EER diagrams)
- Create class diagrams and sequence diagrams for key interactions

### 4. Implementation
- **User Management Module**: Authentication and authorization (Spring Security), user registration and profile management
- **Course Management Module**: CRUD operations for courses, modules, and lessons
- **Enrollment and Progress Tracking Module**: Enrollment logic, progress tracking and dashboard
- **Communication Module**: Messaging system between students and instructors
- **Assessment Module**: Quizzes and automatic grading

### 5. Testing
- Unit tests for all modules (JUnit, Mockito)
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests (Selenium)

### 6. Documentation
- API documentation using Swagger
- User manuals and developer documentation

### 7. Deployment
- Dockerize the application
- Setup Kubernetes for orchestration
- Configure CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)

### 8. Review and Refactor
- Conduct code reviews
- Refactor based on feedback
- Optimize performance

## Diagrams and Documentation
1. **Use Case Diagram**: Interactions between actors (students, instructors, admins) and the system.
2. **Class Diagram**: Structure of the system, including key classes and relationships.
3. **Activity Diagram**: Workflows for key processes (e.g., course enrollment, progress tracking).
4. **Sequence Diagram**: Interactions between objects for specific use cases (e.g., user registration).
5. **DFD (Data Flow Diagrams)**: Data flow through the system at various levels (Level 1, 2, 3, etc.).
6. **EER Diagram**: Database schema showing tables, relationships, and keys.

## Additional Considerations
- **Scalability**: Design to handle a growing number of users and courses.
- **Security**: Implement best practices for securing user data and communications.
- **Performance**: Optimize queries and code for better performance.
- **Usability**: Ensure the platform is user-friendly and accessible.
